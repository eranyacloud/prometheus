# prometheus
The Prometheus exporter setup using systemd allows you to run multiple exporters as systemd services, ensuring they are managed by the system and automatically started at boot. Prometheus exporters are small services that collect specific metrics from various systems and applications, making them available for Prometheus to scrape and monitor.
